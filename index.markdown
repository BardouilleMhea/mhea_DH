### The Gender Split: West Indian Literature, 1961-1990

This site presents [data](https://github.com/BardouilleMhea/mhea_DH), [visualizations](/mhea_DH/charts), [exhibits](/mhea_DH/exhbits), and [a map](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/f46cf935470bb0740a720e3c7f07bf75/authorship-country-1961-1990-highest-concentration-of-female-authors/index.html) drawn from the Writers, Readers, and Scenes: Visualizing Caribbean Literature project to critically compare and explore the *ethnic variances*, *expressive styles*, *authorship countries* and *thematic expression*  of male and female Caribbean authors from 1961â€“to 1990.

In the scope of this project, a *"Caribbean author"* is classified as a writer born in countries belonging or relating to the Caribbean Sea (including the West Indies) and the surrounding coasts, as well as authors of Caribbean heritage.

InThe Gender Split: West Indian Literature, 1961-1990, researcher [Mhea Bardouille](/mhea_DH/about) asks: 
* What are the most common genres used by male and female authors who published books between 1961 and 1990? 
* What are the thematic differences between the works of female and male authors? 
* What are the ethnic parallels and distinctions between male and female authors, and which gender uses their literary works to share their cultural experiences?
* Which Caribbean country has the highest concentration of male and female authors who published between 1961 and 1990?

This project offers different possibilities for users. As a resource for research, the visualizations showcase patterns, trends, and outliers from the data sets that digital humanists and scholars can use in digital pedagogy or in their own projects to explore humanist inquiry.

More importantly, this site acts as a "Caribbean Corner" by reminding users, especially the youth, of the unique culture of the Caribbean, the melting pot, and by appreciating each author's distinct voice as they tell this story.
