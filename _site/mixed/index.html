<h3 id="mixed-ethnicity">Mixed-Ethnicity</h3>

<p><em>Mixed race or multiracial is a term used to denote or relate to an individual whose parents or ancestors are from different ethnic backgrounds.</em></p>

<h3 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h3>

<p>Biological and cultural hybridity in Caribbean society began during the Transatlantic slave trade with the creation of generations of mixed-race individuals of white and black ancestry. Due to socio-economic development and migration, numerous other mixed-race identities have arisen due to the combination of different ethnic backgrounds. <img src="https://www.thepattersonfoundation.org/media/zoo/images/children_of_different_races_c0da0d01d30380b4726b72c55462bd2f.jpg" alt="Mixed Ethnicity" align="right" style="width: 50%;height:30%;margin: 10px 10px" />
Nonetheless, the presence of white-engineered racial divisions within Caribbean society, as well as remnants of European colonial oppression, has placed mixed-race people in an ambiguous position, commonly experiencing preferential treatment or being subjected to hurtful insults, simply due to the complexity of their identity. Furthermore, individuals who do not possess stereotypical mixed-race characteristics, such as “light skin” or “loose hair,” struggle even more with appreciating their mixed identity, a fusion of cultures and experiences inherited at birth.</p>

<br />  Herbert George de Lisser was an Afro-Jewish Jamaican journalist and author. de Lisser’s work rarely focused on his struggles with identity or race; rather, his novels, which were first published in the newspaper The Planter’s Punch, explored cultural themes such as the role of superstition, magic, voodoo, and witchcraft in socialization in Jamaica. Other common themes within his work include the depiction of heroism and the impact of slavery and systematic oppression on Jamaican society. Furthermore, de Lisser was known for his distinct and resonant portrayal of women in his work, appearing in publications such as Jane’s Career and Myrtle and Money.</p>

  <p>“[Herbert George de Lisser is a] distinguished figure in Jamaican intellectual, artistic, political, and social circles.” - Frank M. Birbalsingh</p>

<p>Olive Senior is a Jamaican poet, novelist, short story, and non-fiction writer, internationally recognized for her literary works. Growing up, Senior, who is of mixed-race heritage, had what Jamaicans would call “light skin” and “good hair”. However, in her low-income childhood village, Tory, these usual symbols of status and privilege did not differentiate her or her family apart from their predominantly African-heritage neighbours. Senior’s works commonly explored her childhood, identity, ethnicity, and the religious, political, and historical contexts of Jamaica.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Poetry matters because it is a tool for helping us to discover who we are. As individuals, as Caribbean peoples, as citizens of the world. - Olive Senior”</p>
