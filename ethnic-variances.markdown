In Christina Boyles's article, ["Making and Breaking: Teaching Information Ethics through Curatorial Practice,"](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/4/000404/000404.html) she argues that ethical considerations should be made in the research and curation of archives, databases, and information resources so that the information included or presented does not reinforce Euro-capitalist worldviews or exclude or spread misinformation and bias about marginalized communities.

During the project's name curation process, I decided to emphasize the various ethnic variances as they apply to gender, to gain a deeper understanding of the rich Caribbean culture and to preserve and present accurate information about some of the ethnicities that can be found in the Caribbean region.
