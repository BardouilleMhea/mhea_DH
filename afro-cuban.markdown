### Afro-Cuban

*Afro-Cubans is the term used to describe Cubans of black African ancestry, mainly from West Africa or Yoruba*

### Historical Context {#historical-context}

During the Transatlantic Slave Trade, Cuba imported more than 800,000 African slaves. The free labour provided by these individuals was critical in the development of Cuba's shipping sector. Nevertheless, the growth of Cuba's black population heightened xenophobia among citizens of European descent. 

> Cuba is a land of contradictions. It's a nation that is largely defined by the descendants of enslaved Africans, yet also a place where those influences are often denied and racism is rarely confronted. - Johnica Reed Hawkins

As a result, there was a mass emigration of Cubans of European descent and Afro-Cuban culture, art, and religion, which was commonly referred to as "cosa de negros" or "something blacks do," was loathed because it was seen as a threat to the country’s identity. Even after slavery was abolished in 1888, the militia, legislature, and other political leaders suppressed all forms of Afro-Cuban cultural expression.

However, in the 1920s, the Afrocubansimo movement validated the African-influenced culture of Cuba and acknowledged Blackness as part of Cuba’s national identity.
