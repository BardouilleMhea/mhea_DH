### Prologue {#Prologue}

In the [visualization of themes](/mhea_DH/themes), an overview of previously published works on thematic differences between male and female authors was given. Interestingly, the author of the article "Gender and Literature" by Pázámy Péter Catholic University argued that the gender roles of the early 18th and 19th centuries would have influenced the behavior, morality, and feelings of women, thereby impacting their literary pieces. However, the Femist Movement in the 1970s in the Caribbean would have reduced these predetremined gender roles and gender identity, thus having less of an effect on these authors.

In the Gender Split, West Indian Literature 1961-1990, a dataset of common themes in Caribbean literature was created for analysis. These themes include:

1. Adolescence 
2. Classism
3. Colonialism
4. Coming of age
5. Education
6. Family relationships (Mother-daughter relationships)
7. Gender and Sexuality
8. Identity 
9. Migration
10. Mythology and folk
11. Nature
12. Neo-colonialism
13. Politics
14. Postcolonialism 
15. Poverty
16. Power 
17. Racism
18. Slavery 
19. Young boys growing up
20. Young girls growing up

This exhibit will critically compare and contrast the themeatic expression of male and female authors, particularly in books before the Femist Movement, in the early periods of the social movement and decades after.

### Methodology {#method}

To create this exhibit, a sample of 8 literary pieces that were included in the project, Gender Split 1961-1990, were chosen at random. 

From these literary pieces, samples of approximately 6-7 pages were included in [Voyant-Tools] (https://voyant-tools.org/) for distant reading purposes.

This sample selection process was advised by Schuyler K. Esprit, PhD, who was also the director of Create Caribbean Research Institute.

> "Distant reading" is a computational text mining method used in Digital Humanities to analyze large amounts of literary pieces and provide microanalytics such as quantitative data and cultural and historical criticism.

The sample of literary pieces:

**Authored by males**
1. V.S Naipaul : A House for Mr Biswas (1961)
2. Earl Lovelace : Dragon Can't Dance (1979)
3. Derek Walcott: Fortunate Traveller (1981)

**Authored by females**
1. Jean Rhys: Wide Sargasso Sea (1966)
2. Merle Hodge: Crick Crack, Monkey (1970)
3. Phyllis Shand Allfrey : The Orchid House (1982)
4. Dionne Brand: In Another Place, Not Here (1996)
5. Jamaica Kincaid: The Autobiography of my Mother (1996)

### Thematic Overview: Cirrus {#themes}

Using Voyant Tools, [Cirrus](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/cirrus), a world cloud that visualizes the top frequency words of a corpus was created to determine the thematic elements present in male and female authors' literary pieces.

*Cirrus - Male Authors*       **VS**    *Cirrus - Female Authors*

### TexturalArc {#textual}

Voyant's [*TextualArc*](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/textualarc) feature is a visualization of the terms in a document that includes a weighted centroid of terms and an arc that follows the terms in document order.


The sample texts included in the Gender Split, 1961-1990 will be represented on the perminter of a cricle, starting at the top and looping around clockwise. Each occurrence of a term pulls the term toward its location on the perimeter and the position of the term label is the mean of these forces (or weighted [centroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid)). 

Each sample is "read" from start to finish and the occurrences of the currently read term are shown by lines to the perimeter. 

Users of this project can also hover over any term to see its occurrences on the perimeter, and interact with the different male and female authored samples included in this exhibit.
