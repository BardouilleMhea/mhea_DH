### Prologue {#Prologue}

In the [visualization of themes](/mhea_DH/themes), an overview of previously published works on thematic differences between male and female authors was given. Interestingly, the author of the article "Gender and Literature" by Pázámy Péter Catholic University argued that the gender roles of the early 18th and 19th centuries would have influenced the behavior, morality, and feelings of women, thereby impacting their literary pieces. However, the Femist Movement in the 1970s in the Caribbean would have reduced these predetremined gender roles and gender identity, thus having less of an effect on these authors.

In the Gender Split, West Indian Literature 1961-1990, a dataset of common themes in Caribbean literature was created for analysis. These themes include:

1. Adolescence 
2. Classism
3. Colonialism
4. Coming of age
5. Education
6. Family relationships (Mother-daughter relationships)
7. Gender and Sexuality
8. Identity 
9. Migration
10. Mythology and folk
11. Nature
12. Neo-colonialism
13. Politics
14. Postcolonialism 
15. Poverty
16. Power 
17. Racism
18. Slavery 
19. Young boys growing up
20. Young girls growing up

This exhibit will critically compare and contrast the themeatic expression of male and female authors, particularly in books before the Femist Movement, in the early periods of the social movement and decades after.
