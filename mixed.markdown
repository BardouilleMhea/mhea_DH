### Mixed-Ethnicity 
  
 *Mixed race or multiracial is a term used to denote or relate to an individual whose parents or ancestors are from different ethnic backgrounds.*

### Historical Context {#historical-context}

Biological and cultural hybridity in Caribbean society began during the Transatlantic slave trade with the creation of generations of mixed-race individuals of white and black ancestry. Due to socio-economic development and migration, numerous other mixed-race identities have arisen due to the combination of different ethnic backgrounds. <img src="https://www.thepattersonfoundation.org/media/zoo/images/children_of_different_races_c0da0d01d30380b4726b72c55462bd2f.jpg" alt="Mixed Ethnicity" align ="right" style="width: 50%;height:30%;margin: 10px 10px"  >
Nonetheless, the presence of white-engineered racial divisions within Caribbean society, as well as remnants of European colonial oppression, has placed mixed-race people in an ambiguous position, commonly experiencing preferential treatment or being subjected to hurtful insults, simply due to the complexity of their identity. Furthermore, individuals who do not possess stereotypical mixed-race characteristics, such as "light skin" or "loose hair," struggle even more with appreciating their mixed identity, a fusion of cultures and experiences inherited at birth.

<br/>  Herbert George de Lisser was an Afro-Jewish Jamaican journalist and author. de Lisser's work rarely focused on his struggles with identity or race; rather, his novels, which were first published in the newspaper The Planter's Punch, explored cultural themes such as the role of superstition, magic, voodoo, and witchcraft in socialization in Jamaica. Other common themes within his work include the depiction of heroism and the impact of slavery and systematic oppression on Jamaican society. Furthermore, de Lisser was known for his distinct and resonant portrayal of women in his work, appearing in publications such as Jane's Career and Myrtle and Money.

Olive Senior is a Jamaican poet, novelist, short story, and non-fiction writer, internationally recognized for her literary works. Growing up, Senior, who is of mixed-race heritage, had what Jamaicans would call "light skin" and "good hair". However, in her low-income childhood village, Tory, these usual symbols of status and privilege did not differentiate her or her family apart from their predominantly African-heritage neighbours. Senior's works commonly explored her childhood, identity, ethnicity, and the religious, political, and historical contexts of Jamaica.

__Book Overview__

Jane's Career: A Story of Jamaica was the first West Indian novel to feature a black protagonist. In this novel, de Lisser captures the hope and struggle of a young woman leaving home for the first time. "Jane," who is moving to Kingston, which is described as a "very big and wicked city," in which "a young girl like you, who the Lord has blessed with a good figure and a face, must be careful not to keep bad company." Preparing to send young Jane off to the Jamaican capital, village elder Daddy Buckram attempts to offer her advice on how to keep herself safe from Satan and sinners alike. Despite his serious tone and gloomy portrait of urban life, all Jane can think of is the wonder and excitement waiting for her in Kingston. Raised in the countryside and brought up in a conservative Christian family, Jane sees her new job as a means of achieving independence and establishing her own identity as a proud black woman, and of forging her own path in a new, modern Jamaica. In spite of her dreams, however, Jane finds herself subjected to the cruelties of her employer, Mrs. Mason, who threatens to send a letter to her parents alleging all sorts of imagined misdeeds. Through it all, she tries to maintain a sense of pride, hopeful that hard work—and even romance—will set her free.
