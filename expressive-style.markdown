### Prologue {#Prologue}

Many researchers have sought to determine if there are fundamental differences in fiction written by men and women.From her experience, fiction editor, Beth Hill, explains that some of the the differences she has encountered in these genders' writing styles are seen in the development of the plot, where male writers get to the point sooner and the action of the story happens immediately and without hesitation. Moreover, Hill discloses that through her professional career she has realized that the characters in novels authored by male writers "don't hold back." They speak plainly (often boldly and crudely, but not always) and they leave the reader in no doubt about who they are and what they want, in comparison to the characters written by female authors.

Furthermore, in a Quora post on a similar discussion, users stated that in fiction writing, male authors are usually more informative—that is, they relate to the details of the situation—whereas female authors are more responsive—they relate to the personal effects of the situation.

From the [visualization of Expressive Styles (Genre)](/mhea_DH/genre), it was concluded that from the sample of data included in this project, both male and female authors are more likely to write novels. This exhibit will seek to determine if there is a fundamental difference in fiction (novels) authored by male authors and female Caribbean authors between 1961 and 1990.
