### Prologue {#Prologue}

Many researchers have sought to determine if there are fundamental differences in fiction written by men and women.From her experience, fiction editor, Beth Hill, explains that some of the the differences she has encountered in these genders' writing styles are seen in the development of the plot, where male writers get to the point sooner and the action of the story happens immediately and without hesitation. Moreover, Hill discloses that through her professional career she has realized that the characters in novels authored by male writers "don't hold back." They speak plainly (often boldly and crudely, but not always) and they leave the reader in no doubt about who they are and what they want, in comparison to the characters written by female authors.

Furthermore, in a Quora post on a similar discussion, users stated that in fiction writing, male authors are usually more informative—that is, they relate to the details of the situation—whereas female authors are more responsive—they relate to the personal effects of the situation.

From the [visualization of Expressive Styles (Genre)](/mhea_DH/genre), it was concluded that from the sample of data included in this project, both male and female authors are more likely to write novels. This exhibit will seek to determine if there is a fundamental difference in fiction (novels) authored by male authors and female Caribbean authors between 1961 and 1990.

###  Earl Lovelace: The Dragon Can't Dance (1979) {#Lovelace}

![The Dragon Can't Dance](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7a/The_Dragon_Can%27t_Dance.jpg/220px-The_Dragon_Can%27t_Dance.jpg)


**Plot Summary**

In this novel set in postcolonial Trinidad, Lovelace writes about Aldrick Prospect, the main character, who spends the entire year recreating his dragon costume for Carnival and his interactions with other individuals in his neighborhood, Calvary Hill, which is an African-Trinidad urban slum.

The inhabitants of Calvary Hill are getting ready for their Carinval celebration: steel bands are practicing, calypso singers and writers are creating new songs, and Adlrick is feverishly working on his dragon costume, in hopes of doing the dragon dance, a dance that expresses all the people's frustrations and memories of their warrior past.

This Carnival season,however, is different from previous ones: steel bands are gaining commercial sponsors; the people's old combative spirit is giving way to passive acceptance; and Aldrick's friends are drifting away and starting new lives.

Aldrick's emotions about the "final symbol of rebellion" linger, and he engages in a futile uprising against the government.

He is then imprisoned, but unlike the others, he refuses to accept defeat, and when he is released—still depressed—he returns to Calvary Hill and undergoes self-reflection.

Overall, this story takes the reader on a trip into the colonial mentality, exposing the deep-seated issues that plague a country that has yet to reconcile its colonial past and racial differences.

**Characterization**

The characters in this novel include:

* Aldrick, main protagonist, embodies "the dragon"
* Sylvia, love interest of the Hill, represents youth and sexuality
* Belasco "Fisheye" John, the "bad-john" of the Hill
* Pariag, the Indian, represents racial discrimination and exclusion
* Philo, original member of the Band, becomes a rich Calypso singer
* Ms. Cleothilda, "Queen" of the hill, Philo's love interest
* Ms. Olive, Sylvia's mother
* Mr. Guy, Sylvia's boyfriend
* Dolly, Pariag's wife
* Ms. Caroline

**Themes***

One of the themes that emerges in this literary piece is **identity**. The characters, such as Aldrick, are trying to rediscover and re-establish a personal identity in something other than Carnival, but their multi-generalational roots in this culture prevent them from developing productive attachments. For instance, towards the end of the book, the readers see Aldrick struggle with self-identity as he questions, "What was he without the dragan?" What was there to define him? "

Thus, Aldrick symbolizes the large number of Trinidadians seeking a sense of identity on a personal and social level as the country transitions from a colonial to an independent nation.

Another underlying theme in this novel is a call for local people to be given **power.** Adlrick, Fisheye, and other men attempt to hijack a police van and drive crazily through the town center, shouting: "We are the People's Liberation Army," attempting to call out the people to rise and reclaim their power.

Lastly, this novel explored the theme of **poverty**. The individuals in this neighborhood are former slaves or indentured laborers who "survive here, holding their poverty as a possession."

### Jean Rhys: Wide Sargasso Sea (1966) {#Rhys}

![Wide Sargasso Sea (1966)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1e/JeanRhys_WideSargassoSea.jpg/220px-JeanRhys_WideSargassoSea.jpg)

**Plot Summary**

In Wide Sargasso Sea, initially set in Jamaica a short while after the Slavery Abolition Action of 1833, the readers follow Antoinette's story, which is told from her time of her youth in Jamaica. Antoinette relates the story of her life from childhood to her arranged marriage to an English gentleman, Mr. Rochester.
Anotinette, subsequent
ly called Berth by her husband, is trapped in an unhappily married life in which her husband declares her insane, takes her to England, and isolates her from the rest of the world in his home.

> Antoinette is a child in a patriachal society in which she fully belongs neither to Europe nor to Jamaica.

**Characterization**

The characters in this novel include:

* Antoinette (B), daughter of ex-slave owners and protagonist
* Annette, Antoinette's mother
* ROchester, Antoinette's English husband 
* Christophine
* Mr. Mason
* Aunt Cora
* Alexander Cosway 
* Ameline
* Sandi Cosway 
* Daniel Cosway
* Richard Mason
* Tia
* Pierre
* Mr. Luttrell
* Baptiste
* Godfrey
* Sass
* Grace Poole
* Leah
* Mrs. Eff
* Mother St. Justine
* Mannie
* Maillotte 

**Themes***

One of the underlying themes of this novel is **slavery** and **racism.** 
This novel is set shortly after the abolition of the slave trade, which caused great racial tension among Jamaica's white and black residents.

Anotinette's family were planters who owned slaves until the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act, which resulted in the family losing their wealth. They were then subjected to terms such as "white nigger" or "white cockroach" by the island's black inhibtants because of their **poverty** and were openly harassed and assualted. The villagers, in a fit of rage, set fire to the home, killing Antoinette's brother.

### Comparison: The Dragon Can't Dance & Wide Sargasso Sea {#compare}

There are a few similarities and differences between these two novels.

Firstly, both of these novels are set during a transitional period on the Caribbean island in which they are located. In Lovelace's novel, Trinidad is going through an adjustory period from being a colonial territory to an independent nation, whereas in Rhys' novel, Jamaica's society is adpating from a society where slavery was legal to one where it was abolished. While these scenarios and settings are quite different, they are both periods of high social tension.

Secondly, in Rhys' novel, there are more characters that move the plot of the novel in comparison to Lovelace's novel. This might be because "Wide Sargasso Sea" has two main settings: Jamaica and England.

Lastly, these novels explore similar themes but from different angles. For instance, both novels express theme **"power"**. In "The Dragon Can't Dance," Aldrick is trying to encourage the local citizens of Calvary Hill to rise against the government and have the power to reclaim their identity and their carnival traditions. Conversely, in "Wide Sagarsso Sea", Rhys expresses the theme of power, from the perspectives of slave owners and slaves, as well as the lack of power Antoinette and other women had as a result of being subjected to a patriachal society, resulting in an unequal power balance between men and women.

Furthermore, the themes of **poverty** are also showcased in this novel, but from opposite angles. Lovelace demonstarted the poverty former ex-slaves face, since during servitude they were not allowed to have property or other assets in their names or be educated, which resulted in these indivduals being improvised. Conversely, Rhys explores this theme through the effect emancipation had on whites and other European settlers. Anotinette's family, who were ex-slave owners, became poor because they could not afford to run the sugar plantations, now no longer having unpaid labour.

Alternatively, the novels speak about different themes, such as race in Wide Sargasso Sea and identity in The Dragon Can't Dance.
